# README
## Why
I'm making this to learn and improve knowledge about Python programming, how to use Git, resources surrounding Git, database management, data structuring and project management.
## Project
MusicDB is a personal project to manage a music mp3 library in local and cloud


### Libraries to install
+ eyed3
+ selenium

## Working on next..

### Selenium browser
Add component that uses webscraping (*Selenium*) to extract HTML code from my Bandcamp collection. With the end goal of compare my Bandcamp collection to local to make sure they are synced/ not missing any albums.
The Bandcamp database need only contain albums

### Implement a compare program for backup
A backup is stored on a external drive. In the program it should run a
populate code like 1.0 on both directories then compare if there are discrepancys between the two directories. 
Or run one sides compares to validate, without polutation code.


# Databases
+ musicdatabase
